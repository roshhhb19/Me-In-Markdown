Hi, my name is Roshni Bastani and I am a sophomore in Chatsworth Charter Highschool. I love playing volleyball and am currently on the varsity volleyball team. For fun I love building legos, shopping, eating food, and sometimes painting. My favorite book is Do Not Disturb by Freida McFadden because it is a mysterious and horror book where you have to wait until the end to find out who the killer was. I haven’t learned too many skills besides volleyball but I have learned many religions and the importance of them in my history class. 

A personal achievement for me would be making it to varsity sophomore year. Some goals I have for the upcoming school year is getting straight A’s, understanding everything I learned in each class, and improving a ton in volleyball by the end of the school year. During this summer I went to Europe, specifically London and Paris. In London we visited family and friends, ate lots of food and visited tourist sites like Buckingham Palace. In Paris we visited the Eiffel tower and went all the way up to the third floor which was an amazing view.

 We also ate more food and walked around. Not to mention we visited the famous mall(Galeries Lafayette Champs) and went to a perfume museum. Overall I had the best time but if I were to pick I would say Paris was my favorite and has always been my dream vacation. To be honest, I love all kinds of food and don’t have a specific favorite dish. I hope to achieve understanding the basic concept of computer science and being able to code without any help. My most memorable experience I had during this summer was probably getting to see my aunt after so long and some of my cousins as well. 

Last year in computer science near the end of the year we programmed a game which was the most recent technology-related project. I have been playing volleyball for two years now and I have learned a lot of new skills compared to last year since I am on a higher team. I sometimes draw colors for fun like coloring books or just drawing random stuff. I have not participated in any volunteer or community service work over the summer but I have during school which included making food boxes for the poor or helping out teachers. In our religion we sometimes have special days which include going to temple or eating only vegetarian food. 

My favorite summer memory I made with my friends was their birthday parties because I got to see all my friends at once which is rare because we all are busy nowadays. When I was younger my dad unfortunately passed away from cancer and he was a doctor. After that when I start getting older I want to work in the medical field and hopefully try to find a cure to cancer someday. <br>
